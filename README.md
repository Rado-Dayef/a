# Coffee Shop App

This Flutter project is a coffee shop app consisting of five main screens: **Get Started**, **Home**, **Details**, **Favorite**, and **Cart**. The app utilizes the GetX state management library and follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture for efficient organization and management of code.
